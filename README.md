# Maze Runner

This is a program written in python using tkinter to generate and solve mazes.

Here is a demonstration of the maze:

To traverse the maze, I used DFS. If it had more than one selection, I took advantage of the random library. 

To build this locally, you have to clone the repository and run [main.py](src/main.py) (which already has the set up for the demonstration), assuming you have the required libraries set up. To set up different mazes, tweak the parameters in main, or feel free to tweak the code itself if you would like to implement various search algorithms (that is not DFS with random selection of direction)

I will be working on more complex projects in the future. Tune in!
